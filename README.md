Some code I put together to firstly make a database from Python for SQL. The program also allows users to login and view their personal information. They will be able to sign up, login and view (and extension - update) their information that is stored in the database. It is written in Procedural Python format. It also includes code for password hashing algorithms. There is an explanation beside most lines of code :)
